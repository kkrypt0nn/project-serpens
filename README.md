> **Note** Due to my military service from **July 2023** until **November 2024** I will not be able to work on this project a lot, most likely only during weekends if I have time and motivation ^-^

> **Warning** This is a WIP tool & library that is **very unstable** and **not fully optimised**, use at your own care! This README will also be reworked.
